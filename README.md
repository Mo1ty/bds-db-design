Project work.

What's inside:

ddls_dmls                          - folder has PostgreSQL scripts saved as separate files in the same condition they were added into the database, so it could be easier to analyze what is inserted inside every table.

ERD_diagram.png                    - the diagram of the database made in Crow's Foot Notation.

MySQL_database_creation_script.sql - ddl-script in MySQL.

car_service_data_script            - script with all INSERT commands.

car_service_database_script        - ddl-script with the database and it's schema.

data_maker_script.py               - this script helped us fill the database with unique data (names, surnames, rent prices e.t.c.).

pgAdmin_evid_screenshot.png        - evidence screenshot. Shows that our database is real, filled with data and working. Used select to show some data from different tables.
